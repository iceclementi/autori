## **Introduction**  
<span style="text-align: justify; display: block">
This **Nuke** application is a simple yet powerful task management system that is dedicated to providing **NUS students** a more efficient way to organise their _modules_ and _tasks_.<br>  
You will be interacting with the application via the command line. With the **Nuke** application, you will be able to perform various operations to manage your _modules_ and _tasks_ such as adding, deleting and listing your  _modules_ and _tasks_. You may also add additional properties to your _tasks_ such as _files_, _deadlines_, and _priorities_.<br>  
**Nuke** facilitates users by automatically sorting user-added _tasks_ and displaying the most important and urgent ones to the users. In the long term, it strives to enhance the quality of NUS studentsâ€™ lives by serving as the one-stop platform for efficient management of module tasks.<br>  
If you are an **NUS student** and have not tried out **Nuke** yet...  
What are you waiting for? Give **Nuke** a shot, and you will see how amazing it is!   
</span>
    
<br>

## General Usage  
This section will explain the fundamental structure of the **Nuke** application, and important guidelines to follow to ensure smooth usage of the application.  

### Nuke Structure
**Nuke** follows the structure of a **Directory Tree** _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. This Directory Tree comprises various levels:

##### <u>Directory Levels Table</u>  

| Directory Level | Description                                                                      |
|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Root**        | The **base** of the Directory Tree. Only **one** root exists in the entire Tree.<br>Added _modules_ are in this level. |
| **Module**      | The **second** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _categories_ are in this level.   |
| **Category**    | The **third** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _tasks_ are in this level.    |
| **Task**        | The **fourth** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _files_ are in this level.       |
| **File**        | The **last** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Nothing else can be added.                                         |

<br>

```
	// Todo add a sample Directory Tree diagram here
```

#### Root   
The **Root** Directory is the **base** of the entire Directory Tree. Only **one** root exists in the entire Tree. _Modules_ are added into this level into a **Module List**. A _module_ consists of both a *module code* and a _module title_. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note !!</b> <br> 
Only <b>NUS modules</b> are allowed to be added in <b>Nuke</b>.  
</div>

#### Module
The **Module** Directory is the **second** level of the Directory Tree.  Each _module_ has a **Category List** that has several _categories_ to categorise your _tasks_, such as Lecture, Tutorial and Assignment, so that you can further organise your _tasks_. A _category_ consists of a _name_ and a _priority_ to indicate the importance of the _tasks_ in that _category_.

#### Category
The **Category** Directory is the **third** level of the Directory Tree. Each _category_ has a **Task List** that can contain any number of _tasks_, which are ideally related to the _category_. A _task_ has several attributes, namely the _description_, _deadline_ of the _task_ if any, _priority_ and the _done status_ of the _task_.

#### Task
The **Task** Directory is the **fourth** level of the Directory Tree. Each _task_ can have _files_ attached to the it. _Files_ are stored in the **File List**. The _file_ must have a _file name_ and the _path_ to the _file_.   

#### File
The **File** Directory is the **last** level of the Directory Tree. It contains no other directories.   

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br> 
The <b>Nuke</b> application adheres to this Directory Tree structure strictly. It is important to note that you can only add a directory into a directory which is <b><i>exactly</i> one level lower</b>. <br>
For example, you can only add a <i>task</i> into the <b>Category</b> directory, and not directly into the <b>Module</b> directory.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Tip</b> <br> 
You can shorten the commands you enter by first entering into a directory. Then you do <b>not</b> need to enter the full <i>directory path</i> in your command! <br>
To learn how to traverse the various directories, see the <a href="#6-change-directory">Change Directory</a> command.
</div>

<br>

## Command Format  
In this User Guide, the format for each feature _(command)_ will usually be of this form:  
`CommandWord <attr0> -pfix1 <attr1> ... [ -pfix2 <attr2> ... ] { -pfix3 <attr3> -pfix4 <attr4> ... }`

### Command Word
Each command you give to **Nuke** has to begin with its corresponding unique **command word**. This helps **Nuke** to know that you want it to execute a particular command.  

### Attribute
**Attributes** are information to be provided in the command. An **attribute** for the command will be wrapped in angular brackets `< >` to help you to recognise it.   

### Prefix
A **prefix** is used to provide additional supplementary information to the command. More information on the various **command prefixes** can be found [here](#command-prefixes).   

### Optional
Some **attributes** and **prefixes** are _optional_ and the command can still execute properly even when omitted. However, they may be useful if you want to provide a more specific information to the command. Optional **attributes** and **prefixes** will be wrapped in square brackets `[ ]` to help you to recognise them.   

### Any
There are times when you may have to include at least one from a set of **attributes** and **prefixes**. You may choose to include one <i>or</i> more from the set, but <b>not</b> none of them. Such **attributes** and **prefixes** will be wrapped in curly brackets `{ }` to help you to recognise them.   

<br>

## Command Prefixes  
On many occasions, you may be required to enter more information to describe the commands you give to **Nuke**. For example, when adding a _task_, you may need to specify the _module_ and _category_ to add the _task_ into. You may also want to include additional attributes such as the _deadline_ and _priority_. All these information can only be recognised by **Nuke** if they are preceded by the correct **prefix**.<br>   
All **command prefixes** in **Nuke** begins with a `-` and followed by a **letter**. Below is the exhaustive list of **command prefixes** and general information that should follow after.   

#### <u>Command Prefix Table</u>  

| Command Prefix | General Definition                                               |
|:--------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-m`           | The _module code_ of the _**m**odule_                            |
| `-c`           | The _name_ of the _**c**ategory_                                 |
| `-t`           | The _description_ of the _**t**ask_                              |
| `-f`           | The _name_ or _path_ of the _**f**ile_                           |
| `-d`           | The _**d**eadline_ of the _task_                                 |
| `-p`           | The _**p**riority_ of the _category_ or _task_                   |
| `-e`           | To indicate whether filtering is done **e**xactly                |
| `-a`           | To indicate whether filtering is done across **a**ll directories |

<br>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation">  </i><b>Note</b> <br> 
Because each <b>prefix</b> begins with a <code>-</code>, <b>Nuke</b> has to unfortunately restrict your choice of names for the directories. <br>
Specifically, each word in the name of your directory has to begin with a alpha-numeric <i>(i.e. non-symbol)</i> or underscore character.
</div>

<br><br>  

# Features  
## 1. Add  
Adds a _module_, _category_,  _task_ or <i>file</i> into their respective lists.<br>

As mentioned previously, **Nuke** follows the structure of a [**Directory Tree**](#nuke-structure) _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. Therefore, **Nuke** also supports Linux file-system-related command for creating a directory: `mkdir`

- When you are at the **Root Directory**, `mkdir <module code>` will add a *module* into your **Module List**.
- When you are at the **Module Directory**, `mkdir <category name>` will add a _category_ into your **Category List**.
- When you are at the **Category Directory**, `mkdir <task description>` will add a _task_ into your **Task List**.

The above mentioned commands have to be done in the corresponding directories, and the commands below can be done in any directories, but less generic.

#### a. Add a Module into your Module List  
Adds a _module_ into your **Module List**. The **Module List** contains all your added _modules_ and can be viewed via the List Module command.

#### Format  
`addm <module code>`  
- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the   _module_  
> **Note**: The _module code_ is **case-insensitive**. However, it must correspond to a valid **NUS module**. Only **NUS modules** can be added in this version of **Nuke**.

#### Example Usage

```
	addm cs2113t
```

#### Expected Outcome    

```
root :
addm cs2113t
SUCCESS!! Module CS2113 Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming has been added.

#### <br>  

#### b. Add a Category into your Category List  
Adds a _category_ into your **Category List**. The **Category List** contains all your added _categories_ in the _module_ and can be viewed via the List Category command.

#### Format  
`addc <category name> -m <module code> [ -p <priority> ]`  

- `category name` -- The _name_ of the   _category_
- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the _module_   to contain the _category_ to be added
- `priority` -- A number indicating the  _priority_ of the _category_
> **Note**: You need **not** include the `module code` information if you are currently in that _module_'s directory. You can move to the  _module_'s directory via the [Change Directory](#6-change-directory) Command.  
> **Note**: The `priority` that you give must be a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. The bigger the number, the more important the category. If the `priority` is not given, then it will be set to **0**.  

#### Example Usage

## 2. List  
Lists the _modules_, _categories_ or _tasks_ in their respective lists.<br>

As mentioned previously, **Nuke** follows the structure of a **Directory Tree** _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. Therefore, **Nuke** also supports Linux file-system-related command for listing files in a directory: `ls`

- When you are at the **Root Directory**, `ls` will list out all your *module*s in your **Module List**. `ls <module code>` will list out all *category*s in the **Category List** in the *module*
- When you are at the **Module Directory**, `ls` will list out all the *category*s in your **Category List**. `ls <category name>` will list out all *task*s in the **Task List** in the *category*
- When you are at the **Category Directory**, `ls` will list out all the *task*s in your **Task List**.

The above mentioned commands have to be done in the corresponding directories, and the commands below can be done in any directories, but less generic.

#### a. List your Modules

List all *module*s in your **Module List**. The **Module List** contains all your added _modules_ and can be viewed via the List Module command.

#### Format  

`lsm [keyword]`   

> **Note**: If keyword is provided, `lsm` will list out all modules with module code containing the keyword, otherwise, `lsm` will list out all modules.

#### Example Usage    

```
	lsm
```

#### Expected Outcome 

![image-20200401011642619](images/ug_lsm.png)



#### b. List your Categories

List all *category*s in your **Category List**. The **Category List** contains all your added _categories_ in the _module_ and can be viewed via the List Category command.

#### Format  

`lsc [ -m <module code> ]`  

- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the _module_ to contain the _category_ to be added

> **Note**: You need **not** include the `module code` information if you are currently in that _module_'s directory. You can move to the  _module_'s directory via the [Change Directory](#6-change-directory) Command.

#### Example Usage

```
	lsc -m c3235
```

```
	lsc
```

#### Expected Outcome

![image-20200401012031973](images/ug_lsc.png)



#### c. List your Tasks  

List all the *task*s in your **Task List**. The **Task List** contains all your added _tasks_ in the _category_ and can be viewed via the List Task command.

#### Format  

```
lst [ -m <module code> -c <category name>]
```

> **Note**: You need **not** include the `module code` if you are currently in that _module_'s directory. Also, you need **not** include both `module code` and `category name`  if you are currently in that _category_'s directory. You can move to the  the respective directories via the [Change Directory](#6-change-directory) Command.  

#### Example Usage 

```
	lst -m cs3235 -c Assignment
```

```
	lst -c Assignment
```

```
	lst

#### d. List your undo tasks in sorted order  

List all the undo *task*s in your **Task List**. The *task*s will be sorted in ascending order of `deadline` by deafault. User can also specify in the command to sort *task*s in descending order of `priority` by adding `-p` prefix.

#### Format  

```
lsts [ -d -p (choose 1; default -d) ]
```

> **Note**: You need **not** include the `-d` if you want to sort tasks in terms of `deadline`. You are supposed to choose only one prefix between `-d` and `-p`. 

#### Example Usage

```
	lsts
```

```
	lsts -p
```

#### Expected Outcome



#### e. List your tasks under specific module in sorted order 

List all the *task*s in one of added *module*s. The *task*s will be sorted in ascending order of `deadline` by deafault.

#### Format  

```
lsmtd <module code>
```

> **Note**: You need **not** include the `module code` if you are currently in that *module*'s directory. Sepcifying a `module code` will make the command to list tasks in that *module*.

#### Example Usage

```
	lsmtd
```

```
	lsmtd CS2113
```

#### Expected Outcome



## 3. Delete  
Deletes _modules_, _categories_ or _tasks_ from their respective lists.<br>

As mentioned previously, **Nuke** follows the structure of a **Directory Tree** _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. Therefore, **Nuke** also supports Linux file-system-related command for deleting a directory: `rm`

- When you are at the **Root Directory**, `rm <module code>` will remove a *module* from your **Module List**.
- When you are at the **Module Directory**, `rm <category name>` will remove a *category* from your **Category List**. 
- When you are at the **Category Directory**, `rm <task name>` will remove a _task_ from your **Task List**.

For Delete command, user will be prompted to confirm by entering `y` or `yes`  or to abort by entering `n` or `no` after entering the Delete command.

The above mentioned commands have to be done in the corresponding directories, and the commands below can be done in any directories, but less generic.

#### a. Delete Modules from your Module List

Delete a _module_ from your **Module List**. The **Module List** contains all your added _modules_ and can be viewed via the List Module command.

#### Format  

`delm <module code>`  

- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the _module_  

> **Note**: The _module code_ is **case-insensitive**. However, it must correspond to a valid **NUS module**. Only **NUS modules** can be deleted in this version of **Nuke**.

#### Example Usage    

```
	delm cs3235
```

#### Expected Outcome

```
root :
delm cs3235
Confirm delete CS3235 Computer Security?

root :
y
SUCCESS!! Module(s) have been deleted.
```

#### b. Delete Categories from your Category List   

Delete a _category_ from your **Category List**. The **Category List** contains all your added _categories_ in the _module_ and can be viewed via the List Category command.

#### Format  

`delc <category name> -m <module code>`  

- `category name` -- The _name_ of the   _category_
- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the _module_   to contain the _category_ to be added

> **Note**: You need **not** include the `module code` information if you are currently in that _module_'s directory. You can move to the  _module_'s directory via the [Change Directory](#6-change-directory) Command.

#### Example Usage    

`delc Lecture -m cs2113t` when not in the *module*'s  directory

`delc Lecture` when in the *module*'s directory

#### Expected Outcome    

```
root :
delc Lecture -m cs3235
Confirm delete Lecture?

root :
y
SUCCESS!! Category/Categories have been deleted.

- `task description` -- The _description_ of the _task_
- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the _module_   to contain the _category_ to be added
- `category name` -- The _name_ of the   _category

> **Note**: You need **not** include the `module code` if you are currently in that _module_'s directory. Also, you need **not** include both `module code` and `category name`  if you are currently in that _category_'s directory. You can move to the  the respective directories via the [Change Directory](#6-change-directory) Command. 

#### Example Usage    

`delt urgent assignment -m cs3235 -c Assignment` when not in the *module*'s  directory

`delt urgent assignment -c Assignment` when not in the *category*'s directory

`delt urgent assignment` when in the *category*'s directory

# Miscellaneous Information  

## Help  
In the event that you ever forget the usage of a command, you can look it up within the **Nuke** program itself. All you need to do is to enter the *keyword* `help`, followed by the command you wish to query.     

<br>  

## Exiting the Nuke Program  
Exiting the **Nuke** program is simple. Simply enter `bye` to exit.  
Upon exiting, the program will [save](#saving) your entire Directory List into a file in your device.  

<br>  

## Loading and Saving  
The **Nuke** program loads and saves your entire Directory List **automatically**, so there is no explicit way to freely load or save your file.    

### Loading 
Loading is done once you start up the **Nuke** program. The data from the saved *directory list file* in your device is read to initialise your Directory List from when it was last saved.

### Saving  
Saving is done upon executing each of your commands in the **Nuke** program. Your Directory List will be saved into a *directory list file* in your device.    

<br>  

## Date Time Formats  
Any *date time* data that you provide has to adhere to certain formats pre-defined by the **Nuke** program. Failure to do so will likely result in the program to be unable to recognise your input command, and a warning will be shown.    
Instances when you may need to enter a *date time* will be when adding a _deadline_ to your _tasks_.
    
Here are the following *date time* formats:  
    
### Date Formats  
There are **two** types *date* formats allowed.  

#### 1. Words  
You may enter **only** the following *date* words.  
- `today` or `tdy` -- represents the <u>current</u> date  
- `tomorrow` or `tmr` -- represents the <u>next</u> date  
- `yesterday` or `yst` -- represents the <u>previous</u> date  
  
> **Note**: All dates are taken with reference to the current date on your device.  
  #### 2. Standard Date Format  
This refers to the typical dates that are represented with **numbers** and **delimiter symbols**.    

In this **Nuke** program, *dates* should be in the order of **day**, **month**, then an <u>optional</u> **year**. If the **year** is not provided, the program will automatically assume it to be the **current year**.  Also, the **day**, **month** and **year** should only be entered as **numbers** and not words *(e.g. January is not accepted for the **month** attribute)*.  
    
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `/` and `-` as valid delimiters for *dates*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted provided you include the **year** of the *date* *(e.g. 1/1/20, 1/1 and 010120 are accepted, but not 0101).*  

An **exhaustive** list of the standard *date* formats is given below for your reference.  
```
 dd/MM/yyyy, d/MM/yyyy, dd/M/yyyy, d/M/yyyy,   
 dd/MM/yy, d/MM/yy, dd/M/yy, d/M/yy,  
 dd/MM, d/MM, dd/M, d/M, dd-MM-yyyy, d-MM-yyyy, dd-M-yyyy, d-M-yyyy,   
 dd-MM-yy, d-MM-yy, dd-M-yy, d-M-yy,  
 dd-MM, d-MM, dd-M, d-M, ddMMyyyy, ddMMyy
```
> **Info**: `d` represents the **day** of the date. `M` represents the **month** of the date. `y` represents the **year** of the date.  

### Time Formats  
The **Nuke** program accepts most time formats that are represented with **numbers**, **delimiter symbols** and <u>optional</u> **am-pm markers**.    
    
The *time* should be in the order of  **hour**, then **minute**. The **seconds** attribute of *time* should **not** be given. The **minute** attribute must be a **double** digit *(i.e. single digits must be padded with a 0 in front)*. The **minute** attribute is also <u>optional</u>, and should it be omitted, the **Nuke** program will automatically set the **minute** to be 0. Both the **12-h** format and the **24-h** format are valid *time* formats for this program.    
    
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `:` and `.` as valid delimiters for *time*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted.  

Lastly, the **am-pm marker** is an <u>optional</u> attribute, and should it be omitted, the **Nuke** program will automatically assume the *time* to follow the **24-h** format.  

An **exhaustive** list of the *time* formats is given below for your reference.  
```  
 h:mma, H:mma, H:mm, h.mma, 
 H.mma, H.mm, hmma, Hmma, Hmm, 
 ha, Ha, H
```
 > **Info**: `H` and `h` represents the **hour** for the 24-h and 12-h time format respectively. `m` represents the **minute**. `a` represents the **am-pm markers**.
