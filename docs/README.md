## **Introduction**  

### **Purpose**  
<span style="text-align: justify; display: block">
This document describes the structure and software design decisions for the <b>Nuke</b> application. The <b>Nuke</b> application is a simple yet powerful task management application that is dedicated to providing <b>NUS students</b> a more efficient way to organise their <i>modules</i> and <i>tasks</i>.  
</span>
    

### **Scope**  
<span style="text-align: justify; display: block">
This document will cover the structure and software design decisions for the implementation of <b>Nuke</b>. The intended audience for this document are developers, designers and software testers of <b>Nuke</b> <i>or</i> other similar task management application.
</span>  

### **Design Goals**  

```
	// To be done.
```

### **Definitions**  
```
	// To be done.
```

<br>

## **Setting Up**  
Refer to the guide [here](#) to set up.  

<br>

## **Design**  

<br>

## **Command Implementation**  
This section will describe the significant details of how the commands in <b>Nuke</b> are being implemented.  

### 1. Add Command
#### Overview
The **add** feature adds modules, categories, tasks and tags into the Module, Category and Task List respectively.

#### 1.1. Add module feature

The add module feature enable the user to add modules into the Module List.

When the user first requests to execute the `addm` command(*assuming the command format given is valid*) to add a module by providing its name, the application will parse the input after `addm`  command word as the module code. From here, there are **three** possible outcomes:

1. The module specified by the user is not provided by NUS -- No module will added.
2. The module specified by the user is already added -- No module will be added.
3. The module specified by the user is provided by NUS and have not been added -- Module will be added.

#### Feature Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `AddModuleCommand` class which add the modules specified by the user. It overrides the `execute()` method which extends from the abstract `AddCommand` class which extends from the abstract `Command` class.   The `execute()` method's role is to execute the adding module operation and do necessary checks .

The `AddCommand` will first try to call the static method `add` in `ModuleManager`  class, which will try to add the module specified by the user, exception will thrown according the following rules:

1. `DuplicateModuleException` will be thrown if the module specified by the user is contained in the `ArrayList` named `moduleList` in `ModuleManager` class.
2. `ModuleNotProvidedException` will be thrown if the module code specified by the user is not contained in the `HashMap` named `modulesMap` in `ModuleManager` class.

Below are the class-diagram for the involved classes:

![image-20200326014336120](images/Add_Module_Command_Class_Diagram.png)

<span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Add Module Command Class Diagram</b></i></small></span>

#### Example Usage

The addition of modules will be illustrated as follows.

James is a user and wants to add the module with the module code of "CS3235". Assume that he has the current modules:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 NO |  MODULE CODE   |                                 MODULE TITLE
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 1  |     CS1231     |                             Discrete Structures
 2  |     CS2100     |                            Computer Organisation
 3  |     CS2113     |              Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Total modules: 3
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

1. James will simply enter the command `addm cs3235`

   After the input is parsed as an **add module task** and executed, the `AddModuleCommand#execute()` will call `ModuleManager#add()` to add the module cs3235. In the `ModuleManager#add()` method, it will call `ModuleManager#contains()` to check if the module cs3235 exists in the `ArrayList` named `moduleList` , then it will check if the module code "cs3235" is a key in the `HashMap` named `modulesMap`, after all, it will instantiate an `Module` object with the module code "CS3235" and respective title "Computer Security", then add the object into the `moduleList`.

2. James receive the following feedback:
```
   root :
   addm cs3235
   SUCCESS!! Module CS3235 Computer Security has been added.
   
   root :
   lsm
   Here are what you are looking for...
   
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    NO |  MODULE CODE   |                                 MODULE TITLE
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    1  |     CS1231     |                             Discrete Structures
    2  |     CS2100     |                            Computer Organisation
    3  |     CS2113     |              Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming
    4  |     CS3235     |                              Computer Security
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   Total modules: 4
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```



Below is a *sequence diagram* to illustrate the above example scenario.  

```

```



#### 1.2. Add Category and Task Features

Since add category and add task feature are implemented in a similar pattern, they can be explained together.

The add category/task enable the user to add category/task/tag into Category/Task/Tag List.(One to one correspondence, which means the user can only add category to Category List, task to Task List).

When the user first request to execute the **add** command*(assuming the command format given is valid)* to add a category/task by providing its name, the application will parse the input after `addm` /`addc` command word as the name for category/task. From here, there are **three** possible outcomes:

1. The specified upper parent directory does not exist. -- No category/task will be added.
2. The name of the specified category/task already exist. -- No category/task will be added.
3. The specified upper parent directory exist and the name of the specified category/task does not exist. -- The specified category/task will be added.

#### Feature Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `AddCategoryCommand` and `AddTaskCommand` class which add the corresponding category or task respectively.

The above-stated two classes overrides the `execute()` method which extends from the abstract `AddCommand` class which extends from the abstract `Command` class. The `execute()` method's role is to execute the adding category/task operation and do necessary checks.

The `AddCategoryCommand` and `AddTaskCommand` will first call the `getParentDirectory()` method to get the parent directory, then it will instantiate a `Category`/`Task` object and try to call `add` method in their respective parent directory class to add the new object, exception will be thrown according to the following rules:

1. `ModuleNotFoundException` will be thrown if the specified module code does not exists in the `ArrayList` of Module when adding a new category or task.
2. `CategoryNotFoundException` will be thrown if the specified category name does not exists in the `ArrayList` of Category in `CategoryManager` in `Module` when adding a new task.
3. `IncorrectDirectoryLevelException` will be thrown if the user is performing the`addc`/`addt` command in the wrong directory without specifying their full parent directories.(For example, when user trying to execute `addc` in a `Root`/`Task` directory, or trying to execute `addt`  in a `Root`/`Module` directory)
4. `DuplicateTaskException`/`DuplicateCategoryException` will be thrown if the name of the category/task already exist in the current directory.

Below are the class-diagram for the involved classes:

```
to-do: add the class-diagram
```

#### Example Usage

The addition process for *category* and *task* are similar. In this example, the addition process for *category* will be illustrated as a series of steps.

James is a user and wants to add a *category* named  "misc" under the *module* cs3235. Assume that he has the current Module List and current Category List in the module cs3235:

```

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Total categories: 5
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

1. James has two choices:

   1. enter `cd cs3235` to enter the module directory then enter `addc misc` to add the category.
   2. enter `addc misc -m cs3235` to add the category at the root directory.

   Suppose James use the first method, after the second input, the input is parsed as an **add task** command and executed, the `AddCategoryCommand#execute()` will call `AddCategoryCommand#getParentDirectory()` to get the current parent directory, then it will instantiate an `Category` object with the name "misc". After which `CategoryManager#add()` will be called to add the new object. In the `CategoryManager#add()` method, it will call `CategoryManager#contains()` method to check if the current parent directory contains the category with name "misc", finally add the object into the `ArrayList` of `categoryList`.

2. James receive the following feedback:

   ```
   root :
   addc misc
   SUCCESS!! Category misc is created.
   ```

### 2. List Command  


<br><br>

### 3. Delete Command  
#### Overview  
The **delete** feature deletes *modules*, *categories* and *tasks* from the Module, Category and Task List respectively.   
When the user first requests to execute the **delete** command to delete a directory by providing its name, the application will first filter for directories with matching names. From here, there are **three** possible outcomes:  

1. There are **no** matches --  Nothing is deleted.
2. There is **one** match -- A prompt will be given to the user to confirm the deletion.
3. There are **multiple** matches -- The list of matches will be shown to the user, and the user chooses which ones to delete. A further prompt will be given to confirm the deletion(s).

#### Feature Implementation  
![Delete Command Class Diagram](images/Delete_Command_Class_Diagram.png)
<span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Delete Command Class Diagram</b></i></small></span>

<br>

The `DeleteModuleCommand`, `DeleteCategoryCommand` and `DeleteTaskCommand` classes in the application facilitates this **delete** feature. They are in charge of deleting *modules*, *categories* and *tasks* respectively. <br>  

As shown in the figure above, those three classes each extends from the abstract `DeleteCommand` class.  They also [override](#) the `DeleteCommand` class's `executeInitialDelete()` method, which role is to prepare the necessary messages or prompts for the user depending on the number of filtered matches. <br>  

The `DeleteCommand` class in turn extends the `FilterCommand` abstract class. The `FilterCommandClass` contains the following vital methods for filtering:  
- `createFilteredModuleList()` -- Creates an `ArrayList` of the filtered *modules*.  
- `createFilteredCategoryist()` -- Creates an `ArrayList` of the filtered *categories*.  
- `createFilteredTaskList()` -- Creates an `ArrayList`of the filtered *tasks*.  

Lastly, the `FilterCommand` class extends the abstract `Command` class that contains the `execute()` method to execute the actual **delete** command.  
<br>  

![Prompt Command Class Diagram](images/Prompt_Class_Diagram.png)
<span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Prompt Command Class Diagram</b></i></small></span>

<br> 

Other than the commands, two prompts are involved.   
The prompt to request for the list number(s) of the item(s) to delete from the filtered list is managed by the `ListNumberPrompt` class. The prompt to request to confirm the deletion is managed by the `DeleteConfirmationPrompt` class.  
<br>


#### Example Usage  
The deletion process for *modules*, *categories* and *tasks* are similar. In this example, the deletion process for *tasks* will be illustrated as a series of steps.  <br>
James is a user and wants to delete some of his *tasks* with *description* "work". Assume that he has the current Task List:  

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 NO |  MODULE  |       CATEGORY       |          TASK          |           DEADLINE           | PTY

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Total tasks: 5
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

![Step 1](images/Number_1.png){: .image-left .step }   
<br>
James will first enter the command to delete *tasks*:  
	`delt work -a`  
	After the input is parsed as a **delete task** command and executed, the `DeleteTaskCommand#execute()` will call `FilterCommand#createFilteredTaskList()` to create the filtered list of *tasks* containing the *description* "work". `DeleteTaskCommand#execute()` will then call its own method `DeleteTaskCommand#executeInitialDelete(filteredList)` to prepare the prompt to request James to enter the list number of the *tasks* he would like to delete.  

![Step 2](images/Number_2.png){: .image-left .step }    
<br>
James receives the following prompt:

```  
Multiple matching tasks found.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 NO |  MODULE  |       CATEGORY       |          TASK          |           DEADLINE           | PTY 
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 1  |  CS1231  |      Assignment      |       group work       |      28/03/2020 06:00PM      | 20

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Total tasks: 3
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Enter the list number(s) of the tasks to delete.
```

He proceeds to enter list numbers `2 3` as he has already completed both *tasks*.  
After the list numbers are parsed, it will call `ListNumberPrompt#execute()`, which will prepare the prompt for the delete confirmation, and then calls `ListNumberPrompt#executePromptConfirmation()`.

![Step 3](images/Number_3.png){: .image-left .step}   
<br>
James receives another prompt:  

```  
Confirm delete these tasks?
tutorial worksheet 10
Big Lab Work
```

He enters `y` to confirm the deletion.
`DeleteConfirmationPrompt#execute()` will be called, which then calls `DeleteConfirmationPrompt#executeMultipleDelete(filteredList)` to delete James' selected *tasks* from his Task List.

![Step 4](images/Number_4.png){: .image-left .step}  
<br>
James receives the final message:

```
SUCCESS!! Task(s) have been deleted.
```

Deletion process ends.

### 4. Edit Command
```
	// To do implementaitons for other features
```


<br>

### **5. Change Directory Command**   
<div>  
The <b>change directory</b> command traverses the user up and down the <b>Directory Tree</b>, much like how the Linux Shell operates. In other words, the user enters the <i>directory name</i> to traverse to that <i>directory</i>, or <code>..</code> to traverse to the parent <i>directory</i>  
</div>   

#### **Implementation**     
<div>   
The <b>change directory</b> command uses various methods from the <code>DirectoryTraverser</code> class in its execution. <br><br>
If the user wants to traverse down to a <i>directory</i>, the <code>ChangeDirectoryCommand</code> will call <code>DirectoryTraverser#findNextDirectory(nextDirectoryName)</code> to get the <code>Directory</code> to traverse to. Then, <code>ChangeDirectoryCommand</code> will call <code>DirectoryTraverser#ftraverseDown(nextDirectory)</code> to move the user to that <i>directory</i>.<br><br>
If the user want to traverse up from the current <i>directory</i> instead, <code>ChangeDirectoryCommand</code> will call <code>DirectoryTraverser#traverseUp()</code> to bring the user back to the <i>parent directory</i>.   
</div> <br>  
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Info</b> <br>   
The <b>Root Directory</b> and the <b>File Directory</b> are the first and last <i>directories</i> in the <b>Directory Tree</b> respectively. If the user attempts to traverse down up the <b>Root Directory</b>, or traverse down a <b>File Directory</b>, an error message will be shown to the user instead. &#128550;
</div> <br>   

Shown below is the <i>sequence diagram</i> when a user executes the <b>change directory</b> command to traverse down to another <i>directory</i>.<br>    
![change directory command sequence diagram](images/dg_cd_seq.png)    
 <span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Change Directory Command Sequence Diagram</b></i></small></span>   
<br>   
   
#### **Design Considerations**     
<b>Traversal Method</b>  
- <b>Alternative 1</b>: User can only traverse one level at a time  <b>(current implementation)</b>    
	- <b>Pros</b>: Simple to implement. Only need to consider getting the direct <i>parent</i> or <i>child directory</i>.   
	- <b>Cons</b>: User may have to keep executing the <b>change directory</b> command just to reach their desired <i>directory</i>, especially if the user's current <i>directory</i> is "far" from the destination <i>directory</i>.    
- <b>Alternative 2</b>: User can traverse more than one level at a time, similar to Linux Shell.     
	- <b>Pros</b>: Saves user time from having to possibly execute the <b>change directory</b> command multiple times. User can simply enter <code>cd directory1/directory2/directory3</code> and move four <i>directory levels</i> down.      
	- <b>Cons</b>: Much harder to implement as we need to consider how the split the String into individual <i>directory names</i>. Furthermore, we have to consider the case if the provided <i>directory name</i> contains <code>/</code>, and how we will implement a method to differentiate the <code>/</code> in the <i>name</i> from a <code>/</code> in the <i>directory path</i>.      

<br>  

  
### **6. Open File Command**    
<div>  
The <b>open file</b> command opens up the <i>file(s)</i> of a <i>task</i> specified by the user. User can choose whether to open a single <i>file</i> in the <i>task</i>, or <b>all</b> the <i>files</i> in the <i>task</i>.  
</div>   
  
#### **Implementation**     
<div>
The implementation of the <b>Open File</b> command uses two important <b>Java APIs</b> &ndash; <code>java.io.File</code> and <code>java.awt.Desktop</code>. The first <b>API</b> is responsible for operations involving file access, while the second <b>API</b> is used to open the file to the Desktop. <br><br>  

The <code>OpenFile</code> class first obtains the list of <i>files</i> from the <i>task</i> to open via the <code>OpenFile#getFilesToOpen()</code> method. Then, <code>OpenFile</code> executes the <code>OpenFile#openFiles()</code> method to open each of the <i>files</i> in the list. 
</div><br>   
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Info</b> <br>   
If there is an error opening a particular <i>file</i> in the list &#128534;, the opening process will not be terminated immediately. Instead, the application will continue to open the rest of the <i>files</i> in the list. <br>
After it has gone through the list, it will then show the user the <i>files</i> that were not opened due to an error.
</div> <br>   
    
Below is a<i>sequence</i> diagram of how the <b>open file</b> command operates: <br>      
![open file command sequence diagram](images/dg_open_file_seq.png)    
 <span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Open File Command Sequence Diagram</b></i></small></span>   

<br>

#### **Design Considerations**     
<b>Allow opening of multiple files</b>  
- <b>Alternative 1</b>: User can open only one file at a time   
	- <b>Pros</b>: Simple to implement. Just search for the corresponding <b>File Directory</b>, get the <i>file path</i>, then open the real file in that <i>path</i>.    
	- <b>Cons</b>: User would usually want to open all or most of the <i>files</i> attached to the <i>task</i>. Opening each <i>file</i> one by one will reduce the ease of using the application.     
- <b>Alternative 2</b>: User can choose which <i>files</i> they want to open from a list of <i>files</i> shown to them  
	- <b>Pros</b>: User can open exactly the <i>files</i> that they require at the moment.      
	- <b>Cons</b>: Much harder to implement as we need to consider how the process to prompt the user to choose the <i>files</i> would be enforced. Thereafter, we need to check if the selection exists in the list of <i>files</i>.    
- <b>Alternative 3</b>: User can choose to open a specified <i>file</i>, or all the <i>files</i> of the <i>task</i> <b>(current implementation)</b>   
	- <b>Pros</b>: User now has a choice, and can choose the best between two options.   
	- <b>Cons</b>: User now has to close the unwanted <i>files</i> that was opened in the process, which may inconvenience the user.   

<br>  

### **7. Info Command**    
<div>  
The <b>info</b> command shows the information of the <i>current directory</i> that the user is in. For example, when in the <b>Module</b> directory, the <b>info</b> command will show the <i>module code</i>, <i>module title</i> and the <i>module</i>'s <i>category list</i> to the user.  
</div>  
  
<br>

#### **Implementation**     
<div>
The implementation of this command is quite straightforward. <br>
The <code>InfoCommand</code> class will call for the <code>DirectoryTraverser</code> class to get the current <code>Directory</code>. Then, the information of the <code>Directory</code> is obtained by calling <code>Directory#toString()</code>. The <i>list</i> to show is generated by the <code>InfoCommand#getListToShow()</code> method. <br>
These information will eventually be shown to the user through the <code>Ui</code>.
</div>  

The <i>sequence</i> diagram of what happens when a user executes the <b>info</b> command is as illustrated:<br>   
![info command sequence diagram](images/dg_info_seq.png)    
 <span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Info Command Sequence Diagram</b></i></small></span>   
<br>  

### **8. Undo and Redo Commands**    
#### **Overview**     
<div>
The <b>undo</b> and <b>redo</b> commands work hand in hand with each other. The <b>undo</b> command undoes a <i>change</i> made to the <b>Directory List</b>. <i>Change</i> here refers to adding, deleting or editing items to the <i>list</i>. The <b>redo</b> command reverts the effect of the <b>undo</b> command.   
</div>  

<br>

#### **Implementation**     
<div>
The state of the <i>directories</i> is being maintained by the <code>ScreenShotManager</code> class. This is done via two <b>stacks</b>, one for <b>undo</b>, and the other for <b>redo</b>.  <br><br>

When the application starts, both stacks are empty. After the applications loads the saved <i>directory list file</i>, the current state of the <i>directories</i> is pushed into the <b>undo</b> stack. 
</div>  
        
![undo command init](images/dg_undo_init.png)
<br>   <br>  
<div>
When a <i>change</i> is made to the <i>list</i> from a successful add, delete or edit command, the <b>new</b> state is  pushed into the <b>undo</b> stack. This is done by the <code>ScreenShotManager</code>'s <code>saveScreenShot()</code> method.  
<br>The new state is also saved by the application. See <a href="#storage-implementation">here</a> to find out more about the storage implementation.
</div>  
         
![undo command change 1](images/dg_undo_change_1.png)
<br>   <br>  
<div>
If the user calls for the <b>undo</b> command, the top-most state in the <b>undo</b> stack is removed and pushed into the <b>redo</b> stack. Then, the <i>list</i> will reload to the current top-most state in the <b>undo</b> stack, which is actually the previous state. All of these are done by the <code>ScreenShotManager</code>'s <code>undo()</code> method.  
</div>  
        
![undo command redo](images/dg_redo.png)
<br>   <br>   
<div>
Conversely, If the user calls for the <b>redo</b> command, the top-most state in the <b>redo</b> stack is removed and pushed back into the <b>undo</b> stack. Then, the <i>list</i> will reload to the current top-most state in the <b>undo</b> stack, which is actually the state which was previously undone. These are done by the <code>ScreenShotManager</code>'s <code>redo()</code> method.  
</div>      
    
![undo command undo](images/dg_undo.png)
<br>   <br>  
<div>
If another <i>change</i> is made to the <i>list</i>, the <b>redo</b> stack is emptied, and the new current state is added into the <b>undo</b> stack <i>(<code>saveScreenShot()</code>)</i>.
</div>  
         
![undo command change 2](images/dg_undo_change_2.png)
<br>   <br>  
<div>
The process continues.
</div> 
<br>
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
An error message will be shown to the user when the user tries to undo when no recent change was made, such as at the start of the application, and when the user tries to redo when nothing was recently undone. 
<br><br>
This is done in the <code>ScreenShotManager</code> class by checking if the <b>undo</b> stack contains more than 1 element (first element is the start-up state), and if the <b>redo</b> stack is not empty respectively. If checking fails, an exception will be thrown. &#128529;
</div>    

Below is a <i>sequence diagram</i> of the undo command in action: <br>   
![undo command sequence diagram](images/dg_undo_seq.png)  
<span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Undo Command Sequence Diagram</b></i></small></span>    
<br>

#### **Design Considerations**     
<b>Number of undos allowed</b>  
- <b>Alternative 1</b>: User can undo only once   
	- <b>Pros</b>: Easy to implement, only need to keep track of the state before the <i>change</i>. As such, it also requires less memory to save.   
	- <b>Cons</b>: May not be feasible as there may be instances when the user may want to undo more than once.  
- <b>Alternative 2</b>: User can undo only a fixed number of times
	- <b>Pros</b>: Allows user to undo more than once. Also, does not incur much memory either as a fixed number of states is saved only.
	- <b>Cons</b>: Need to implement measures and checks for the stacks to ensure they do not exceed the limit, and what to do when it does. User may still request to undo more than the fixed number of times.     
- <b>Alternative 3</b>: User can undo any number of times <b>(current implementation)</b>   
	- <b>Pros</b>: Allows user the freedom to undo any number of times <i>(until the initial state, of course)</i>.   
	- <b>Cons</b>: May require more memory to save the many number of states, although it may not be very significant considering the data size of each state tend to be very small (states are saved as a String).   
<br>    

<b>How undo and redo executes</b>  
- <b>Alternative 1</b>: Saves the state of the entire <i>directory list</i> <b>(current implementation)</b>           
	- <b>Pros</b>: Easy to implement, can reuse the <code>saveList()</code> and <code>loadList()</code> methods in the <code>StorageManager</code> class.
	- <b>Cons</b>: Uses unnecessary memory as the state of the entire <i>list</i> is saved each time, even though only a small <i>change</i> is made.       
- <b>Alternative 2</b>: Individual commands has an <code>undo</code> method, which is able to undo the changes they made.
	- <b>Pros</b>: Uses less memory since the command will only have to record the specific <i>change</i>.
	- <b>Cons</b>: Need to ensure correct implementation of the <code>undo</code> method, and consider scenarios if the command fails to execute.
